**Terminology**
- *Cryptographic Algorithm or Cipher*: This algorithm defines the encryption and decryption processes.
- *Key*: The cryptographic algorithm needs a key to convert the plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa.
- *plaintext* is the original message that we want to encrypt
- *ciphertext* is the message in its encrypted form
  
***Symetric Encryption***
- Sender: plaintext -> cryptographic algorithm with key -> ciphertext
- Recipient: ciphertext -> decryption with same key  -> plaintext
  
***Asymmetric Encryption***
- Sender: plaintext -> recipient *public* key -> ciphertext
- Recipient: ciphertext -> recipient *private* key  -> plaintext
 
***Hashing***
A cryptographic hash function is an algorithm that takes data as input and returns message digest or checksum, as its output.
